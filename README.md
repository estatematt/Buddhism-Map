# Buddhism Map

The .xmind file can be edited with the fairly limited but importantly free XMind application found here: http://www.xmind.net/  It includes hyperlinks to explanations of each topic from popular sites, namely Access to Insight, Tricycle and Buddhanet.

This is "Transcribed" from very informal talk notes of Kathy at Dharmapunx in Brooklyn.  Not were they informal but my (Matthew Aidekman) copy was fairly blurry so I'm hoping to make them more accurate over time.
